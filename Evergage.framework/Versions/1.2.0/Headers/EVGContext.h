/**
 If this context is currently active or not.
 
 A typical `<EVGScreen>` context is active when the screen is visible and the app is not backgrounded.
 
 Besides some initial setup just before becoming visible/active (`<setCampaignHandler:forTarget:>`, `<viewItem:>` etc),
 activity generally occurs while a context is active.
 
 Context activity, in addition to app state and user idleness, can affect campaign delivery, see `<setCampaignHandler:forTarget:>`

/// -----------------------------------
/// @name Campaigns and Stats

/**
 Register a campaign handler for a host-app-defined target within this context.
 Can set nil to clear.
 
 The target should be a unique app-defined string that identifies the type of campaign data consumable by the handler.
 Specifically, `<EVGCampaign>`s designed for a `target` should all share a compatible `data` structure,
 in order to be consumable by any `<EVGCampaignHandler>` registered for that target.
 
 While the context, app, and user is active, the handler may receive asynchronous callbacks (on the main thread)
 with campaigns for the target, in response to actions tracked. The handler code should show/update the campaign to the user,
 when appropriate, and follow best practices using weak references, see `<EVGCampaignHandler>` for example code.
 
 Campaigns may be held for delivery while either:
 
 - The context, app, or user is inactive
 - No handler is found for the campaign's target within this context
 
 For each context and target, only the most recent campaign will be held.
 
 Lifecycle details:
 
 - For an `UIViewController/<EVGScreen>`, it is recommended to always call this method just before becoming visible, specifically `viewWillAppear:`.
 - In order to prevent accidental leaks in the handler block (see `<EVGCampaignHandler>` example code to prevent this), a screen has a limited time to become visible, after which its handlers and held campaigns will be cleared.
 - When a screen transitions to not visible (`viewWillDisappear:`), all handlers and held campaigns are cleared.
 - When a context transitions to not active (typically on app background or `viewWillDisappear:` for a screen), all held campaigns are cleared.
 
 @param handler The campaign handler this context should use for the specified target.
 @param target A unique app-defined string that identifies the type of campaign data consumable by the handler.
